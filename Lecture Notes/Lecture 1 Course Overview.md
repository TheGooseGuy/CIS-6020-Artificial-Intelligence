# Intro
Q: What is Aritificial Intelligence?  
A: [1]It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.

Q: OK, so what is intelligence?  
A: Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. Varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people, many animals and some machines.

## Big Questions
- Can machinese think? (?)
- Must/should they think like humans do? (No)
- Can they learn from their experience? (Yes)
- Can they have common sense? (No)
- If so, how? If not, why not? (...)
- What does this say about human beings? (...)
- What does this say about the mind? ("Philosophy")
# Brief History of AI
1. Babbage
2. Ada Lovelace
   > "The Analytical Engine has no pretentions whatever to originate anything. It cando whatever we know how to order it to perform.”
3. Propositional logic - George Boole, 1847
4. "Robot" - Karel  Capek, 1921
5. minimax - John von Neumann, 1928
6. Cybernetics Norbet Wiener, 1940s
7. Neural Networks, 1940s & 1950s
8. *I, Robot* - Isaac Asimov, 1950
9. Turing Test, 1950
10. Early work on Chess - Alan Turing, 1950
11. Logic Theorist and GPS, 1950s
12. Neural nets - Marvin Minsky, 1951
13. AI as a discipline - Dartmouth summer conference, 1956

15. GPS - Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, 1957
16. `Lisp` - Jogn McCarthy, 1958
17. Analytical approach to language - Noam Chomsky (1950s)

## Recent AI (Hot Topics)
- Neural Networks, Deep Learning
- Machine learning, Data Mining
- Exploiting Big Data
- Autonomous Vehicles, Robotics
- Text Mining, Natural Language Technology, Speech
- Computer Vision
# Why AI?
For Engineering: get machines to do useful things.  
Cognitive Science: model and understand how natual minds and mental phenomena work.  
Philosophy: explore basic, interesting and important philosophical questions.

## Act Well
- For For a given set of inputs, generate output that’s
not necessarily correct but gets job done.
- [2]Heuristic: rule of thumb, strategy, trick or simplification which drastically limits search for solutions in large problem spaces.
- Heuristics don’t guarantee optimal solutions or even any solution at all: ***all that can be said for a useful heuristic is that it offers solutions which are good enough most of the time*** – Feigenbaum and Feldman, 1963, p. 6
