# Uninformed Search
Breadth First Search(BFS), Depth First Search(DFS), Uniform Cost Search(generalization of BFS), Iterative Deepening(blend of DFS and BFS) (Depth-first Iterative Deepening)

Searching Backward from Goal, Bi-directional Search

# Informed Search
Heuristic

All domain knowledge used in search is encoded
in the heuristic function, h(node)

weak vs strong methods:

weak methods: generate and test, space splitting, subgoaling,
